Debounced Button Library:
=========================

{} Bounce2:

https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2

Nice documentation in its Github page

=============
OLED Display:
=============

It requires several libraries.

Good tutorial from YouTube: https://youtu.be/7x1P80X1V3E?si=XCHo0VirlMBhQ_VY

In this video he shows how to use .96-inch I2C display, But I used 1.3-inch I2C so I had to use Adafruit SH110X library, otherwise the display was not working. I found this solution here, https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/xaivyd/128x64_oled_display_not_working_properly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Afore mentioned video and the examples that comes with the Adafruit SH110X library are good enough for learning the basic usage of the display. One thing I would like to mention that the display didn’t work until it’s I2C address was set 0X3C.

=======================
Rotary Encoder Library:
=======================

{} RotaryEncoder by Matthias Hertel:

https://github.com/mathertel/RotaryEncoder

I learned from the examples that comes with this library.

===================
Software interrupt:
===================

It used to execute a function at specific intervals, I used it to blink a LED. I came to know it from here, https://youtu.be/i2YsKacRZOs?si=ze_SJcIlJTWVfXVi

{} MsTimer2:

https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/MsTimer2 

I couldn’t find a good documentation but, that video displayed usage of these functions mentioned here, https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/MsTimer2/blob/f90127ce8289b73c2e74b8be222ab7c755621717/MsTimer2.h
